## What I Expect of building this project
I expect by buiding this project that it goes to the public with the same intuition as others finance apps, but with a different perspective, where you actually just have a wallet, the total balance and spences in the first screen, but when you accesss your card inside the wallet, it shows all the information that you need to have a good perspective about how your money is beein used. Also creating challanges/Goals so you get notified if you won that goal or not, making your finance even more easy to controll, and your wallet bigger :sunglasses::moneybag::chart:
